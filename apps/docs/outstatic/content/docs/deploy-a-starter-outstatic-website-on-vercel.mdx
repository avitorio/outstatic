To deploy with Vercel, start by clicking the button below and follow the setup steps:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/avitorio/outstatic/tree/main/examples/basic-blog&env=OUTSTATIC_API_KEY&project-name=outstatic-blog&repo-name=outstatic-basic-blog&demo-title=Outstatic%20Basic%20Blog%20Demo&demo-description=A%20statically%20generated%20blog%20example%20using%20Outstatic&demo-url=https://outstatic-dev-blog.vercel.app/&demo-image=https://outstatic.com/images/outstatic-demo.png&envDescription=API%20Keys%20needed%20for%20installation&envLink=https://outstatic.com/docs/environment-variables)

1. Select **GitHub** as your Git service. Enter your repository name (for example, `outstatic-blog`) and click **Create**.
2. After the repo is created, sign in to [Outstatic](https://outstatic.com/auth/sign-up?provider=github) and create a new project linked to that repository.
3. In your Outstatic project, open **API Keys** and add this callback URL for now:\
   `https://localhost:3000/outstatic`
4. Generate an **API Key**. In Vercel, go to **Add Environment Variables** and paste the `ost_*****` portion to the **Value** field: \

5. Click deploy.

When the deploy finishes, open your site. To access the dashboard, add `/outstatic` to your site URL:

Example: `https://myblog.vercel.app/outstatic`

You should see this page:

![](/docs/api/outstatic/media/avitorio/outstatic-secret/outstatic-2.1/apps/docs/apps/docs/public/images/login-screen-IwNz.webp)

1. Now go back to **API Keys** in Outstatic and add your production callback URL: `https://myblog.vercel.app/outstatic`
2. Return to `/outstatic`, and click **Sign in with GitHub** again.

Congratulations! Now you have a website with a full-featured dashboard to edit your content.

To develop your Vercel deployed website locally, please check the [Local Development](/local-development) page.

We recommend you learn how [Outstatic manages content](/introduction) and also how to [fetch content](/fetching-data) from your front end.
