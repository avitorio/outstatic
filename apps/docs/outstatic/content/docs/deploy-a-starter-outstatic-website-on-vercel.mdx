To deploy with Vercel, start by clicking the button below and follow the setup steps:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/avitorio/outstatic/tree/main/examples/basic-blog&env=OST_GITHUB_ID,OST_GITHUB_SECRET&project-name=outstatic-blog&repo-name=outstatic-basic-blog&demo-title=Outstatic%20Basic%20Blog%20Demo&demo-description=A%20statically%20generated%20blog%20example%20using%20Outstatic&demo-url=https://outstatic-dev-blog.vercel.app/&demo-image=https://outstatic.com/images/outstatic-demo.png&envDescription=API%20Keys%20needed%20for%20installation&envLink=https://outstatic.com/docs/environment-variables)

1. Select GitHub as your git service. Then, type the name of your repository (ex: `outstatic-blog`) and click **create**.
2. Log in to your [Outstatic](https://outstatic.com/auth/sign-up?provider=github) and create a project for the recently created repository.
3. Go to API Keys, add this callback URL: \
   `https://localhost:3000/outstatic`
4. Generate an API Key and paste it in the 

You can now visit your site.

To login to your Dashboard add `/outstatic` to the end of your site url:

Example: `https://myblog.vercel.app/outstatic`

You should see this page:

![](/docs/api/outstatic/media/avitorio/outstatic-secret/outstatic-2.1/apps/docs/apps/docs/public/images/login-screen-IwNz.webp)

There are two ways you can access your dashboard. With GitHub via Outstatic (recommended), or using [Github OAuth](/setting-up-github-authentication).

### Accessing with GitHub via Outstatic (Recommended)

1. On the `/outstatic` page, click **Sign in with GitHub**.
2. Follow the flow to create a free Outstatic account and generate an API key for your project.
3. Copy the API key and add it to your `.env`:

```bash
OUTSTATIC_API_KEY=ost_******************************
```

1. Go back to `/outstatic`, refresh the page, and click **Sign in with GitHub** again.

If everything is set up correctly, you will land in your Dashboard.

You are ready to start creating and editing content. Next, learn how Outstatic manages content.

### Access the dashboard from a deployed site

If you also want to use the dashboard on your production or preview deployment:

1. In the dashboard sidebar, open **API Keys**.

2. Add your deployed site URL as a **Callback Origin URL**.

3. Make sure `OUTSTATIC_API_KEY` is set in the environment variables for that deployment.

To learn more about all available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables ](https://outstatic.com/environment-variables)section of the docs.

Congratulations! Now you have a website with a full-featured dashboard to edit your content.

To develop your Vercel deployed website locally, please check the [Local Development](/local-development) page.

We recommend you learn how [Outstatic manages content](/introduction) and also how to [fetch content](/fetching-data) from your front end.
