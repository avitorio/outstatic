Start using Outstatic in minutes, free on our hosted service. [Create your Outstatic account](/auth/sign-up?provider=github).

## Self-hosting options:

### Which best describes you?

I already have a site that uses Markdown (.md or .mdx) for content **(recommended)**

- [Edit Markdown in any GitHub repository with Outstatic as your CMS.](/using-outstatic-for-markdown-content)

I’m using Next.js and want to add Outstatic to my site

- [Install Outstatic inside your Next.js app.](/getting-started-with-next-js)

I don’t have a site yet. I’m starting from scratch or just exploring

- [Deploy a starter Outstatic site to Vercel](/deploy-a-starter-outstatic-website-on-vercel)
