**Recommended:** Starting with Outstatic 2.0, install the standalone Outstatic Dashboard. [Follow the quick tutorial](/using-outstatic-for-markdown-content), then connect it to your app’s GitHub repository to manage content. Your main app can still use [Outstatic’s data fetching utilities](/fetching-data) as usual.

If you prefer to run Outstatic inside your Next.js app, follow the steps below.

## Add Outstatic to a Next.js app (App Router)

Before you start: Outstatic stores your content as Markdown files in your GitHub repository. Read the [introduction](https://outstatic.com/introduction) to understand how the workflow works.

### 1) Install Outstatic

Choose one:

```bash
npm install outstatic
```

```bash
yarn add outstatic
```

```bash
pnpm install outstatic
```

```bash
bun add outstatic
```

### Create the dashboard routes

Add these three files under `/app`. We recommend placing Outstatic in its own route group so layouts don’t interfere with your main app. In this example, the route group is `(cms)` and the dashboard lives at `/outstatic`.

#### `/app/(cms)/layout.tsx`

```
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body id="outstatic">{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

#### `/app/(cms)/outstatic/[[...ost]]/page.tsx`

```
import 'outstatic/outstatic.css'
import { Outstatic } from 'outstatic'
import { OstClient } from 'outstatic/client'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: { ost?: string[] }
}) {
  const ostData = await Outstatic()
  return <OstClient ostData={ostData} params={params} />
}
```

#### `/app/api/outstatic/[[...ost]]/route.ts` (outside the route group)

```
import { OutstaticApi } from 'outstatic'

export const GET = OutstaticApi.GET
export const POST = OutstaticApi.POST
```

### 3) Run the app

Start your dev server. If you’re running on `http://localhost:3000`, open:

`http://localhost:3000/outstatic`

You should see the Outstatic sign-in screen.

## Sign in options

There are two ways you can access your dashboard. With GitHub via Outstatic (recommended), or using [Github OAuth](/setting-up-github-authentication).

### Accessing with GitHub via Outstatic (Recommended)

Click on **Sign in with Github** and follow the steps to create a free Outstatic account and generate an API key for your project.

Copy the `OUTSTATIC_API_KEY` and update your `.env` file.

```bash
OUTSTATIC_API_KEY=ost_******************************
```

Now go back to the `/outstatic` page, reload it and click on **Sign in with Github** again.

If everything is setup correctly you'll be able to access your Dashboard.

Congratulations! Your Outstatic installation is ready and you can now start creating and editing content.

We recommend you learn how Outstatic [manages content](/introduction).

### Accessing the Outstatic dashboard from your live site

If you want to access your Outstatic dashboard from a deployed site, open your Outstatic dashboard, go to **API Keys** in the sidebar, and add your site’s URL as a **Callback Origin**.

Then add the API key to the `.env` file in the environment where your site is deployed.

To learn more about all the available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables ](https://outstatic.com/environment-variables)section of the docs.
