**Recommended:** Starting with Outstatic 2.0, we recommend installing the standalone Outstatic Dashboard. [Follow this quick tutorial](http://localhost:3001/docs/using-outstatic-for-markdown-content), then connect it to your app’s repository to manage content. Your main app can still use [Outstatic’s data fetching utilities](/fetching-data) as usual.

If you prefer to run Outstatic inside your main app, follow the steps below to get started with Outstatic on Next.js.

## Adding Outstatic to a Next.js website

Before we start, you should know Outstatic saves content as markdown files to your GitHub repository. To understand how this works please read our [introduction](https://outstatic.com/introduction) article.

First install the Outstatic package and dependencies:

```bash
npm install outstatic
```

```bash
yarn add outstatic
```

```bash
pnpm install outstatic
```

```bash
bun add outstatic
```

Once installed, you'll need to add three files to your `/app` folder. We recommend you keep your app and outstatic install in different [route groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) so layouts don't interfere with each other. Here we've named the route group `(cms)`:

`/app/(cms)/layout.tsx`

```javascript
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body id="outstatic">{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

`/app/(cms)/outstatic/[[...ost]]/page.tsx`

```javascript
import 'outstatic/outstatic.css'
import { Outstatic } from 'outstatic'
import { OstClient } from 'outstatic/client'

export default async function Page(props: { params: Promise<{ ost: string[] }> }) {
  const params = await props.params;
  const ostData = await Outstatic()
  return <OstClient ostData={ostData} params={params} />
}
```

And lastly, the api route (outside of the route group): `/app/api/outstatic/[[...ost]]/route.ts`

```javascript
import { OutstaticApi } from 'outstatic'

export const GET = OutstaticApi.GET

export const POST = OutstaticApi.POST
```

Start your dev server. Assuming you're on `http://localhost:3000` you can access your dashboard at `https://localhost:3000/outstatic`.

You should see this page:

![](/docs/api/outstatic/media/avitorio/outstatic-secret/outstatic-2.1/apps/docs/apps/docs/public/images/login-screen-IwNz.webp)

There are two ways you can access your dashboard. With GitHub via Outstatic (recommended), or using [Github OAuth](/setting-up-github-authentication).

### Accessing with GitHub via Outstatic (Recommended)

Click on **Sign in with Github** and follow the steps to create a free Outstatic account and generate an API key for your project.

Copy the `OUTSTATIC_API_KEY` and update your `.env` file.

```bash
OUTSTATIC_API_KEY=ost_******************************
```

Now go back to the `/outstatic` page, reload it and click on **Sign in with Github** again.

If everything is setup correctly you'll be able to access your Dashboard.

Congratulations! Your Outstatic installation is ready and you can now start creating and editing content.

We recommend you learn how Outstatic [manages content](/introduction).

### Accessing the Outstatic dashboard from your live site

If you also want to access your Outstatic dashboard through a deployed site you'll need to click the **API Keys** button in your Outstatic dashboard sidebar and add a new **Callback Origin URL**.

Don't forget to add your API Key to your .env where you are deploying your website.

To learn more about all the available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables ](https://outstatic.com/environment-variables)section of the docs.
