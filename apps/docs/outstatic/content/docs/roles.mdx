Roles are available in **Outstatic PRO** and are designed for teams.

Instead of giving everyone full access, you can assign the right level of access to each person.
This keeps your workspace organized, reduces mistakes, and helps your team ship content faster.

## Why Roles Matter in PRO

- **Safer collaboration**: only trusted people can change critical settings.
- **Clear responsibilities**: everyone knows what they own.
- **Faster workflows**: editors and authors can focus on publishing, while managers handle team operations.
- **Better scaling**: as your team grows, roles help you stay in control.

## Role Overview

### Owner

Best for founders or workspace owners.
Has full control over everything, including billing, team access, and project/workspace settings.

### Admin

Best for trusted team leads.
Can manage almost everything in day-to-day operations, including people, projects, and content.
Does not handle billing.

### Manager

Best for team coordinators.
Can manage members and invitations, and can also manage collections and content.
Cannot change core admin controls like role setup, billing, or project settings.

### Editor

Best for content leads.
Can manage content and collections, but cannot manage team administration or billing.

### Author

Best for writers and contributors.
Can focus on creating and updating content without access to team or account administration.

## Quick Comparison

| Role | Billing | Team access | Project/settings control | Collections | Content |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `owner` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `admin` | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `manager` | No | Yes | Limited | Yes | Yes |
| `editor` | No | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| `author` | No | No | No | No | Yes |

If you are not sure which role to choose, start with the lowest role that matches the person’s job and promote only when needed.

That approach keeps your PRO workspace secure and easy to manage.
