Clone the `outstatic-dashboard` project to your machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:avitorio/outstatic-dashboard.git
cd outstatic-dashboard
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Start your dev server. Assuming you're on `http://localhost:3000` you can access your dashboard at `https://localhost:3000/outstatic`.

You should see this page:

There are two ways you can access your dashboard. With GitHub via Outstatic (recommended), or using [Github OAuth](/setting-up-github-authentication).

### Accessing with GitHub via Outstatic (Recommended)

Click on **Sign in with Github** and follow the steps to create a free [Outstatic.com](http://Outstatic.com) account and generate an API key for your project.

Copy the `OUTSTATIC_API_KEY` and update your `.env` file.

```bash
OUTSTATIC_API_KEY=ost_******************************
```

Now go back to the `/outstatic` page, reload it and click on **Sign in with Github** again.

If everything is setup correctly you'll be able to access your Dashboard.

Congratulations! Your Outstatic installation is ready and you can now start creating and editing content.

We recommend you learn how Outstatic [manages content](/introduction).

### Deploying the Outstatic dashboard from your live site

If you also want to access your Outstatic dashboard through a deployed site you'll need to click the **API Keys** button in your Outstatic dashboard sidebar and add a new **Callback Origin URL**.

Don't forget to add your API Key to your .env where you are deploying your website.

To learn more about all the available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables ](https://outstatic.com/environment-variables)section of the docs.
