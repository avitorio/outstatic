Clone the Outstatic Dashboard to your machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:avitorio/outstatic-dashboard.git
cd outstatic-dashboard
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Start the dev server. If it is running at `http://localhost:3000`, open your dashboard at:

`http://localhost:3000/outstatic`

You should see this page:

There are two ways you can access your dashboard. With GitHub via Outstatic (recommended), or using [Github OAuth](/setting-up-github-authentication).

### Accessing with GitHub via Outstatic (Recommended)

1. On the `/outstatic` page, click **Sign in with GitHub**.
2. Follow the flow to create a free Outstatic account and generate an API key for your project.
3. Copy the API key and add it to your `.env`:

```bash
OUTSTATIC_API_KEY=ost_******************************
```

1. Go back to `/outstatic`, refresh the page, and click **Sign in with GitHub** again.

If everything is set up correctly, you will land in your Dashboard.

You are ready to start creating and editing content. Next, learn how Outstatic manages content.

### Access the dashboard from a deployed site

If you also want to use the dashboard on your production or preview deployment:

1. In the dashboard sidebar, open **API Keys**.

2. Add your deployed site URL as a **Callback Origin URL**.

3. Make sure `OUTSTATIC_API_KEY` is set in the environment variables for that deployment.

To learn more about all available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables ](https://outstatic.com/environment-variables)section of the docs.
