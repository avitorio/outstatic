Outstatic v2.0 offers support for Next.js 15. If you are using Next.js 14, please use v1.4 instead.

### Params:

On Next.js 15, params should be awaited:

`/app/(cms)/outstatic/[[...ost]]/page.tsx`

```typescript
import 'outstatic/outstatic.css'
import { Outstatic } from 'outstatic'
import { OstClient } from 'outstatic/client'

export default async function Page(props: { params: Promise<{ ost: string[] }> }) {
  const params = await props.params;
  const ostData = await Outstatic()
  return <OstClient ostData={ostData} params={params} />
}
```

### Styles

We've added a few components which are styled using a `outstatic` css namespace (id).

To make sure your dashboard works with the new styles, you should add the id to your `app/(cms)/layout.tsx`'s `body` tag.

`/app/(cms)/layout.tsx`

```javascript
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body id="outstatic">{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Media Files (No code changes needed)

We are now using a **Media Library** page. You will have to define a **Repo Media Path** and a **Public Media Path**. You will be prompted to set up your paths either from the Media Library page or when trying to upload an image to a document.

It should work the same as before, but with the Media Gallery you will be able to easily reuse images you've already uploaded to your repository.

### Common errors:

#### Cannot find module 'outstatic/client' or 'outstatic/server' or its corresponding type declarations.

Update your `tsconfig.json` :

```json
# from:
"moduleResolution": "node",

# to:
"moduleResolution": "bundler",
```

#### **TailwindCSS related errors**

Outstatic v2 uses TailwindCSS v4. To upgrade your project you can run the codemode:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

If you face other problems, please refer to the [TailwindCSS v4 upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide).
