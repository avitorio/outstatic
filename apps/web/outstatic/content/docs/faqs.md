## Where is the data stored?

All your Outstatic documents and collections are saved as Markdown files in your Github repository. In other words, all saved content creates a commit. The commit message specifies the collection and document that is created, for example, if your document is in the recipes collection the commit message would be: `feat(recipes): apple-pie-recipe`

## Can I host my Outstatic website on a provider other than Vercel?

We specified Vercel on the documentation as it is the only platform we've tried Outstatic on. I don't see why it wouldn't work on other platforms such as Netlify or your own preferred setup.

If you try a different hosting/deploy approach, please [let us know](https://twitter.com/outstatic)!
