Here's a list of all the environment variables needed to run your Outstatic install:

```bash
# REQUIRED Environment variables
OST_GITHUB_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_OR_APPS_ID
OST_GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_OR_APPS_SECRET
OST_TOKEN_SECRET=A_32CHAR_RANDOM_STRING_FOR_YOUR_TOKEN_SECRET
OST_REPO_SLUG=THE_REPOSITORY_SLUG
# If empty AND on Vercel, this will default to VERCEL_GIT_REPO_SLUG

# OPTIONAL Environment variables

# Main branch of the project. If empty, this will default to 'main'
OST_REPO_BRANCH=main

# Repository owner or organization. If empty, logged in GitHub username is used.
OST_REPO_OWNER=myusername

# Where content is saved. Defaults to outstatic/content if empty.
OST_CONTENT_PATH=outstatic/content 

# Specify monorepo folder of your Outstatic content
OST_MONOREPO_PATH=apps/web 

# OpenAI API Key for AI Completions
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXX
```

**Good to know**: To get your repository slug we first try fetching the `OST_REPO_SLUG` environment variable. If that is empty, we try `VERCEL_GIT_REPO_SLUG`, which is one of Vercel's default environment variables. If both are empty, you'll get a warning saying you need to add `OST_REPO_SLUG` to your environment variables.

In case you need help on how to get your GitHub OAuth credentials, please read the [Getting started](/docs/getting-started) section.
