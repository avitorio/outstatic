If you have successfully deployed Outstatic to Vercel and want to run Outstatic locally, here are the steps you need to follow:

## Clone the repository and install dependencies

`git clone` your repository and install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

## Create a different GitHub OAuth app
Since a Github OAuth app cannot have multiple callback URLs, you need to create another [Github OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/developers) for local development.

The only difference is that you need to set the homepage URL to `http://localhost:3000` and set the callback URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`.


## Create a `.env.local` file
You can duplicate the `.env.local.example` file and rename it to `.env.local`. Then, fill in the environment variables with the values from your new Github OAuth app.

Note that you should comment out the `OST_MONOREPO_PATH` environment variable if you are not using a monorepo.

## Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
