Thank you for choosing Outstatic to create your website! We look forward to helping you every step of the way.

Let me give you a quick intro. This demo blog comes with:

```
- Next.js 14
- Tailwind CSS
- Outstatic
- Some MDX components (like this code block)
- Metadata set up for SEO
- And more!
```

## The Basics

Outstatic provides an intuitive [dashboard](/outstatic) interface for easy content management. To ensure a smooth setup, please refer to the [documentation](https://outstatic.com/docs) for instructions on configuring environment variables and other details.

On the dashboard you can create Collections and Documents. Collections allow you to group related documents together, while documents contain the actual content. This flexible structure helps you organize and manage your website efficiently.

Custom fields can be added to collections to tailor them to your specific needs. This allows for greater customization and control over your content. Our [fetching data](https://outstatic.com/docs/fetching-data) functions and metadata DB provide a seamless way to retrieve all the data you need from the front end.

The [content editor](https://outstatic.com/docs/the-content-editor) provides a user-friendly interface with various formatting tools & AI completion to assist you. It is powered by [Novel](https://novel.sh/) & [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/).

Documents can be saved as `draft` or `published`. Saving content as drafts allows you to work on it without publishing it immediately. Once you're ready, you can publish it to make it visible on your website. This gives you the flexibility to review and edit your content before making it available to your audience.

Once you save your content, Outstatic will push changes to your GitHub repository, update markdown files, and redeploy your website automatically. This ensures a smooth workflow and keeps your website up to date with the latest content.

## Start Writing

Now that you have your website set up, it is up to you to start writing and creating content for your audience. With the user-friendly content editor and AI completion tools, you can easily format and enhance your writing. Remember to save your drafts and review them before publishing to ensure the best quality for your readers. Outstatic will handle the rest, automatically pushing changes and keeping your website updated. Happy writing!
