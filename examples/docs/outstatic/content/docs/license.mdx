Starting from version 1.5, Outstatic moved from an MIT License to Functional Source License (FSL). The complete license details are [publicly available](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avitorio/outstatic/refs/heads/canary/license.md). Under this license, you can do anything with Outstatic, with the key restriction being that you cannot compete with its creator.

You're free to run it for most purposes, access the code, make modifications, and share your improvements, including submitting enhancements to the original project. After the two-year period, it transitions to Apache 2.0, a permissive Open Source license. If you'd like to support the project's development, consider [**becoming a sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/avitorio). Sponsors receive benefits including dedicated support channels and promotional space on the project's website and repositories.

**Common Questions**

**What's permitted under the license?** The license allows almost everything except competing with Outstatic's creator. Here are some permitted uses for self-hosted installations:

✅ Businesses can use Outstatic to manage their customer-facing website's content

✅ Independent developers can set up Outstatic for their clients

✅ Creating tutorials or courses about Outstatic (including paid content)

✅ Conducting research projects (commercial or academic)

Activities that aren't permitted include:

❌ Selling access to your Outstatic installation

❌ Providing Outstatic hosting services

**Can I embed the Outstatic editor in my product?**

❌ **This isn't legally permitted**. Incorporating Outstatic into a commercial product would constitute competition with Outstatic's offering, violating the license terms. However, you can utilize code from the two-year-old version, which is Apache 2.0 licensed.

**Is it possible to monetize my Outstatic instance?**

❌ **This isn't legally permitted**. Monetizing an instance would compete with Outstatic's cloud service, breaking the license agreement. The two-year-old code under Apache 2.0 can be used for commercial purposes.
