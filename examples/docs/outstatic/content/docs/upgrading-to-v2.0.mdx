Outstatic v2.0 offers support for Next.js 15. If you are using Next.js 14, please use v1.4.

### Styles

We've added a few components which are styled using a `outstatic` css namespace (id).

To make sure your dashboard works with the new styles, you should add the id to your `app/(cms)/layout.tsx`'s `body` tag.

`/app/(cms)/layout.tsx`

```javascript
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body id="outstatic">{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Media Files (No code changes needed)

We are now using a **Media Library** page. You will have to define a **Repo Media Path** and a **Public Media Path**. You will be prompted to set up your paths either from the Media Library page or when trying to upload an image to a document.

It should work the same as before, but with the Media Gallery you will be able to easily reuse images you've already uploaded to your repository.
