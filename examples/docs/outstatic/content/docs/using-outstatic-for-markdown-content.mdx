Here's how you can get started with Outstatic on any project using markdown.

Requirements:

- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

### **Initiating Setup: GitHub Authentication**

Before diving in, it's essential to configure GitHub Authentication for your project. Outstatic accommodates both **GitHub OAuth** and **GitHub Apps** for authentication purposes:

- **GitHub OAuth:** easier and quicker to set up, ideal for simpler integrations.

- **GitHub Apps:** setup is generally more complex, providing a refined level of access and control.

For those opting for GitHub Apps, please refer to the relevant [GitHub Apps Authentication](/github-apps-authentication) documentation.

#### Setting up a GitHub OAuth Application:

Let’s walk through the steps to create a GitHub OAuth Application, streamlining your project’s initial setup:

- First go to the "Register a new OAuth application" page on GitHub by [clicking here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

- Give your application a name, "Outstatic Blog" for example.

- For the **Homepage URL** and **Authorization callback URL** fields type in any valid url, ex: `https://outstatic.com`, we'll change them later.

- You can leave the **Application** description field empty.

Click on **Register application**. You'll be redirected to your GitHub Oauth App settings page.

Next, click on **Generate a new client secret**. Once done, keep this tab open. We'll need these values for our next steps.

## Cloning the project

Start by cloning the `outstatic-dashboard` project to your machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:avitorio/outstatic-dashboard.git
cd outstatic-dashboard
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Start your dev server. Assuming you're on `http://localhost:3000` you can access your dashboard at `https://localhost:3000/outstatic`.

You should see this page:

Let's update your environment variables.

```bash
OST_GITHUB_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_APP_ID
OST_GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_APP_SECRET
```

Now go back to your GitHub OAuth App settings page and update the following values:

- **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:3000/`.

- **Authorization callback URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/outstatic/callback`

Click on **Update application**.

Restart your service and go back to the `/outstatic` page.

If everything is setup correctly, then you'll see a login page and will be able to access your Dashboard.

Congratulations! Your Outstatic installation is ready and you can now start creating and editing content.

We recommend you learn how Outstatic [manages content](/introduction).

### Access the Outstatic dashboard from your live site

If you also want to access your Outstatic dashboard from your live site you'll need to create a second GitHub OAuth app as GitHub doesn't allow for multiple callback urls for a single OAuth app.

Just repeat the steps for creating a GitHub OAuth app, but this time, replacing `http://localhost:3000/` on **Homepage URL** and **Authorization callback URL** with your actual website address.

Don't forget to add the following environment variables to your Vercel project:

```bash
OST_GITHUB_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_APP_ID
OST_GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_APP_SECRET
```

To learn more about all the available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables ](https://outstatic.com/environment-variables)section of the docs.
