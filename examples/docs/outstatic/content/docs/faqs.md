## Where is the data stored?

All your Outstatic documents and collections are saved as Markdown files in your GitHub repository. In other words, all saved content creates a commit. The commit message specifies the collection and document that is created, for example, if your document is in the recipes collection the commit message would be: `feat(recipes): apple-pie-recipe`o

For convenience we also store metadata in a `metadata.json` file to be used with our [Advanced Data Fetching](/fetching-data#advanced-document-fetching---metadata-db) methods.

## Can I host my Outstatic website on a provider other than Vercel?

Yes. We have seen examples of websites being launched on Netlify and other providers.

If you try a different hosting/deploy approach, please [let us know](https://twitter.com/outstatic)
