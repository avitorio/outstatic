## Who are you?

I'm just curious, or I'm starting from scratch.

- [Deploy a starter Outstatic website on Vercel](/deploy-a-starter-outstatic-website-on-vercel)

I have a website which uses Markdown (.md, .mdx) files for content.

- [Use Outstatic as a CMS to edit Markdown on any GitHub repository.](/using-outstatic-for-markdown-content)

I'm using Next.js and I want to add Outstatic to my website.
