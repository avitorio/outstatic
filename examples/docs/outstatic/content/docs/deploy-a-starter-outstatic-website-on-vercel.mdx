Here's how you can get started with Outstatic.

Requirements:

- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account

### **Initiating Setup: GitHub Authentication**

Before diving in, it's essential to configure GitHub Authentication for your project. Outstatic accommodates both **GitHub OAuth** and **GitHub Apps** for authentication purposes:

- **GitHub OAuth:** easier and quicker to set up, ideal for simpler integrations.

- **GitHub Apps:** setup is generally more complex, providing a refined level of access and control.

For those opting for GitHub Apps, please refer to the relevant [GitHub Apps Authentication](/github-apps-authentication) documentation.

#### Setting up a GitHub OAuth Application:

Let’s walk through the steps to create a GitHub OAuth Application, streamlining your project’s initial setup:

- First go to the "Register a new OAuth application" page on GitHub by [clicking here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

- Give your application a name, "Outstatic Blog" for example.

- For the **Homepage URL** and **Authorization callback URL** fields type in any valid url, ex: `https://outstatic.com`, we'll change them later.

- You can leave the **Application** description field empty.

Click on **Register application**. You'll be redirected to your GitHub Oauth App settings page.

Next, click on **Generate a new client secret**. Once done, keep this tab open. We'll need these values for our next steps.

Awesome, with your GitHub Oauth keys in hand select how you want to use Outstatic:

## Deploy with vercel:

To deploy with Vercel, start by clicking the button below and follow the setup steps:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/avitorio/outstatic/tree/main/examples/basic-blog&env=OST_GITHUB_ID,OST_GITHUB_SECRET&project-name=outstatic-blog&repo-name=outstatic-basic-blog&demo-title=Outstatic%20Basic%20Blog%20Demo&demo-description=A%20statically%20generated%20blog%20example%20using%20Outstatic&demo-url=https://outstatic-dev-blog.vercel.app/&demo-image=https://outstatic.com/images/outstatic-demo.png&envDescription=API%20Keys%20needed%20for%20installation&envLink=https://outstatic.com/docs/environment-variables)

Select GitHub as your git service. Then, type the name of your repository (ex: `outstatic-blog`) and click **create**.

Fill in the following environment variables:

- `OST_GITHUB_ID` with your GitHub Client ID.

- `OST_GITHUB_SECRET` with your GitHub Client secret.

Click on Deploy and wait until it's done.

Once the deploy is concluded, you will be taken to your Vercel dashboard. There you'll see your new website URL.

Go back to your GitHub OAuth App settings page and update the **Homepage URL** with your new website URL.

You'll also need to update the **Authorization callback URL** with your new website URL, but you'll need to add `/api/outstatic/callback` to the end of the url.

Example: `https://myblog.vercel.app/api/outstatic/callback`

Click on **Update application** and you are done!

You can now visit your site.

To login to your Dashboard add `/outstatic` to the end of your site url:

Example: `https://myblog.vercel.app/outstatic`

Congratulations! Now you have a website with a full-featured dashboard to edit your content.

To develop your Vercel deployed website locally, please check the [Local Development](/local-development) page.

We recommend you learn how [Outstatic manages content](/introduction) and also how to [fetch content](/fetching-data) from your front end.
